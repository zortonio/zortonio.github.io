  <h2><center>About Honduras</center></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>65.2% of Hondurans live in poverty. In the rural areas where we work, 54% of households are subject to extreme poverty of incomes of less than $1.25 per day.</p>

  <p>Many children attending current schools in Honduras walk two-three hours on slippery trails round trip every day just to have the opportunity to get an education. Most of these children live in remote, isolated areas. Their families rely mostly on agriculture crops and when the crops do poorly, most struggle to find food.</p>

  <p>Due to this, Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world. It is one of the largest points of entry for illegal drugs to enter the US. The poor economy and lack of formal education forces many families, including children, into the growing crime rates.</p>

  <h2><center>How Your Donation Helps<center></h2>

    <p>In many Honduran families, only some children in the family are given the privilege to attend school due to financial hardships.</p>

    <p>With your donation, you give these children the opportunity to not only attend school, but also provide uniforms, medical care, and hot meals. This one lunch meal is often the only nutritious meal the children receive all day long.</p>

    <p>By keeping these children in school, you help break the cycle of poverty and keep them out of the dangerous drug trade.</p>
