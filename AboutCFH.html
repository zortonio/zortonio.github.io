	<h2>About Climb for Honduras</h2>
		<p>
		My name is Johnny Zeng, and I'm an education volunteer, active duty serviceman in the United States Coast Guard and a passionate mountain climber. In 2011, my senior year in the Academy [SPECIFY], I volunteered in Honduras to help build schools for children. The experience left an indelible mark, and I have wanted to find a way to continue helping that community.
		</p>

		<p>How am I helping? Climbing all of Colorado's 14-thousand-foot peaks to raise money for new schools.</p>

			<h2>Helping Honduras Learn</h2>
				<p>
				Honduras suffers from one of the worst gang epidemics on the planet. Thousands of children join these gangs every year. It's also the 2nd poorest country in the western hemisphere.
				</p>
		<p>
		Quality education has proven again and again to help countries' citizens escape the harsh effects of poverty. Helping Honduras learn is helping the future of its children. Making that happen is where you come in!
		</p>

		<h2>Supporting the Cause</h2>
			<p>Really, it's not about helping me climb mountains. It's helping Honduran children find a way to better opportunity. All donations will go to <a href="#">"Johnny's Honduras Fundraising Campaign"</a>, a fundraiser designed to build schools for kids.</p>
